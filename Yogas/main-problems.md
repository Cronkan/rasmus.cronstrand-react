## Main Problems

I've come to realise that these sections of the body is what I have to work on, to minimize the problems of long hours of sitting down.

### The Lower Back


### The Neck

The hunchback, the vulture neck. 
This one is hard to correct if you, like me, have sat too many hours looking down at a laptop or been having bad posture at a desk. The problem:
- Back of neck does all the work
- Muscles in front is lost
- Shoulders goes forward
- Constricts stuff thats supposed to work

### The Hip and Butt

The problem:
- No need to use, no need for muscles
- Stiffens hamstrings
- Simple task as squatting becomes hard
- Constricts lower back and bloodflow

### The Shoulders
